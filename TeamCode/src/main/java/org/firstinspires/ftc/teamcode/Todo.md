# TeamCode TODO

- [ ] Fix variables
- [ ] Fix Code because block code is horrible
- [ ] make code more documentable


Lines 2-5 are too broad, instead, focus on these things.
- [ ] Change the variables on the driver hub to match the code on github
- [ ] Add correct variables to Hardware.java, TestAuto.java, TestSprint.java, and TestTele.java

- [ ] Implement middle servo controls into TestTele.java
- [ ] Implement flywheel motor controls into TestTele.java
- [ ] Implement intake motor controls into TestTele.java

- [ ] Implement camera into TestAuto.java to scan a QRCode


-
Notes
- Keep the single-servo `intakeMotor` init commented in `Hardware.java` just in case we switch to a motor
- Adjust sleep durations in `TestAuto` for robot's speeds/distances.
