# TeamCode TODO

- [ ] Fix Code because block code is horrible
- [ ] make code more documentable
- [ ] Change the variables on the driver hub to match the code on github
- [ ] Add correct variables to Hardware.java
- [ ] Implement transLeft and transRight servo controls into Hardware.java and then into various things
- [ ] Fix implementation in TestAuto.java for VisionPortal and AprilTag

Notes
- Keep the single-servo `intakeMotor` init commented in `Hardware.java` just in case we switch to a motor
- Adjust sleep durations in `TestAuto` for robot's speeds/distances.
