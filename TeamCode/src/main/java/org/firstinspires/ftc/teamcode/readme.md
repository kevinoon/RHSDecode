> ### “A good programmer is not someone who knows every language or every library — it’s someone who looks at the machine and understands that it’s alive in its own way.  
> Computers are like a canvas. You write code, and it comes to life. That’s creation. That’s art.  
>
> When I wrote TempleOS, I didn’t want it to be like the others. I wanted it to be simple, direct, holy.  
> The goal wasn’t money or fame — it was truth. You can’t fake truth in code. You can’t fake love.  
> The computer knows. God knows.”
